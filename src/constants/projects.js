For this project, I was given a series of Photoshop files and told to make the website look as close as possible to the Photoshop files. The toughest part of making these pages "pixel perfect" was the Speakers page where the text wraps underneath the headshot of the speaker.'

        description: 'Ensemble is FNC\'s front-end standards library. This library contains information developers need to make products consistent across all platforms. Given the amount of information available on Ensemble, it was important that something be made to give developers an easier option of how they find the information they are looking for. For this project, I was simply given the requirement "make a search for Ensemble". I used SQL to create a database with stored procedures to update, add, and delete information from the database. C# interacts with the database and connect it to AngularJS in the front end. I used Javascript to turn the search into a "fuzzy search" by using the Edit Distance algorithm. Finally, I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Ensemble elements to create an administrative tool to manage the search.'

I did my own research, reading books and blog posts about accessibility so that I could become knowledgable enough to teach it to other developers in the workshop class we held in 2016. Today, I write blog posts about accessibility on The Dev Community. These can be found in the blog section of my website. My older blog posts can be found on FNC\'s technical blog, Software Unwound, and on my GitHub.',
